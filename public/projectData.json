    "about": ["For our final group project at Dev Academy Aotearoa, we utilised Agile methodologies to build a modern pager app with a React Native SERN stack. Our social media app Pingpong provides a group notification system to facilitate real-life meetups.",
     "I originally pitched this concept as “BeerPing”. Inspired by the struggle to find a fellow Kiwi friend to share a celebratory beer in Melbourne, as of Jacinda Ardern’s 2017 election, I was driven to ask:", 
     "“How can I spend less time organising with friends to catch up, and more time actually catching up, especially when I want to do so spontaneously?”", 
     "My high standards for quality assurance led me to plan and implement unit testing across the stack, ensuring that our app met the highest standards of functionality and usability."],
    "challenges": ["One of the biggest challenges that PingPong presented was that it didn’t make sense as a web app, due to the need for spontaneous interactions.", "Despite spending the previous 9 weeks learning to use React, our team made the decision to build our app using React Native. This decision introduced friction at every turn, every feature was slightly different from what we had known previously."],
